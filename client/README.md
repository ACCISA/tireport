## Name of the project

TirePort

## Brief description

A web application designed to manage a tire shop data imported from csv and mainly containing records of the different appointments made by staff

## Inspiration

The inspiration for TirePort came from observing the seasonal rush at local tire change shops as they struggled to manage the influx of service requests during the winter tire change season. We noticed that many shops were using outdated or inefficient scheduling systems, leading to overbooked slots, long customer wait times, and lost revenue from potential services. This inspired us to create a solution that not only streamlines the scheduling process but also maximizes efficiency and profitability for these businesses.

## Challenges

One of the major challenges we faced was designing an algorithm capable of efficiently managing the diverse scheduling requirements of different vehicle types while keeping at least one service bay open per category at all times. Balancing this complexity with the need for a simple and intuitive user interface was a significant hurdle.

Another challenge was handling the processing of data from CSV files for service requests, especially in ensuring accuracy and speed in a real-time environment.

Finally, accurately tracking and reporting both actual and potential revenue, including the impact of turned-away customers, required careful consideration and testing to ensure reliability.

## Achievements

TirePort was built using a combination of modern software development tools and methodologies. We utilized a React-based front-end for a responsive and user-friendly interface, coupled with a robust back-end built with Node.js. The scheduling logic was implemented using custom algorithms, ensuring efficient handling of service requests and optimal resource allocation.

Our development process was iterative, focusing on continuous integration and regular feedback from potential users. This approach allowed us to quickly adapt and refine our solution, ensuring it met the real-world needs of tire change shops. We also used chatGPT to debug our code.

## New features learned

Throughout the development of TirePort, our team gained valuable insights into both the technical and operational aspects of building a software solution. We learned about the complexities of scheduling algorithms, particularly in handling overlapping bookings and maintaining availability across different vehicle categories. We also deepened our understanding of user experience design, realizing the importance of an intuitive interface for fast-paced business environments.
